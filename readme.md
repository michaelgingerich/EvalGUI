This is a JavaSE program that I coded based on an assignment that used to be in the Information Systems 3816 lesson plan at University of Missouri - St. Louis.  The assignment concept defines that the program needs to allow the user to enter a team name, scores for presentation criteria, and presentation comments, and then the program inserts that information in an Apache Derby database table.  This program builds on that concept by implementing AbstractTableModel, in order to select and display the data in a JTable.  This program also implements TableModelListener, in order to update the model as data is added in the user interface.  Finally, this program calculates preferred comment column width, in order to accommodate lengthy comments.

Future changes to this program include a more efficient data cache, and a full transition from Swing to JavaFX.
